# Backend Server with NestJs

## Create a NestJS server that provides an API to interact with the data.

## The server should have endpoints to:
### Trigger the NestJS scraping module with the website URL as an
argument.
### Fetch the results of the scraping, including the date and time of
execution, and the count of domains and URLs found.

## Ensure the server runs as a Docker container.
